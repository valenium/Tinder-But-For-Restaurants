# Tender
Welcome to Tender. Tender is a non-commercial MEN-stack app designed for users who may be new to the area, traveling, or simply experimenting with something new to find a nice meal based off their cravings or preferred cuisine types.

Inspired by the concept of dating apps like Tinder and using the Yelp Fusion API, Tender takes your preferences into account and displays information for a variety of restaurants for you to discover around your location and store based off your experience. Tender also lets you view and edit restaurants you have liked, disliked, or saved at any time, and even leave a review for other Tender users to see!
